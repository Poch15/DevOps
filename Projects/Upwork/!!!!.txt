Task 1
Deploy Vault in the local Kubernetes cluster and configure it to use the “Kubernetes Auth Method” for Pod authentication via Service Accounts.
Create a Vault secret that includes two users and their credentials (daniel:password1 & robin:password2) .
Create a new Helm Chart, which includes the NGINX image as default. Secure the default index.html with HTTP basic authentication using the
credentials from the Vault secret.
Create three test cURL requests to test the basic authentication
Request with daniels authentication information - return code should be 200
Request with robins authentication information - return code should be 200
Request with invalid authentication information - return code should be 403

Task 2
Deploy a PostgreSQL database in the local Kubernetes cluster.
To be able to dynamically create database roles / users connect the Vault instance from Task 1 to the PostgreSQL database via the “PostgreSQL
Database Secrets Engine”.
Create a minimal “Hello World” app in a programming language of your choice. The application should periodically check if it can connect to the
PostgreSQL database via dynamic roles / credentials that are automatically obtained through Vault. It should output the result of the check to
stdout.
Deploy the application.
