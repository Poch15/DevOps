Encrypt EBS volume
1) Find the EC2 instance with the unencrypted volume and stop it.
2) Create a snapshot of the EBS volume you want to encrypt.
3) Copy the EBS snapshot, encrypting the copy in the process using an available key
4) Create a new EBS volume from your new encrypted EBS snapshot (This new EBS volume will be encrypted). I find this is also an excellent spot to check the type of storage being used if you are using older/more expensive technology or something not up to the task.
5) Detach the original EBS volume and attach your new encrypted EBS volume, making sure to match the device name (/dev/sda1, etc.). While it says /dev/sdf through to /dev/sdp is available, if this is the root disk, you will need to use /dev/xvda1 in order for the instance to start up again, despite the implication that this might be an invalid device name.
6) Start the EC2 instance up again. Verify that the server is doing the things as expected and that the data is correct.
7) Delete the now detached unencrypted volume. Enjoy peaceful sleep!
